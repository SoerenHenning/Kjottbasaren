# Computer Graphics Project

Developed by SÃ¶ren Henning and Zach Litzinger

## Features

* Moving in x, y and z direction
* Horizontal and vertical rotation
* Direction sunlight
* Headlight on top of the camera, modelled as a point light source with decreasing intensity
* Perspective and orthographic projection (no depth information in orthographic projection due to fact how orthographic projection is)
* Per fragment, per vertex and black and white shading
